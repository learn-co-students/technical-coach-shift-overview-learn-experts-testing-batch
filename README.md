### Pairing with Students
When you are on shift at Pair with a Coach, you'll generally be screensharing with students, although you may also be chatting with a student 1:1 if they are unable to screenshare. Depending on their issue, you may be doing anything from debugging a simple syntax error, to troubleshooting an environment issue, to teaching a concept to a struggling student. We limit our screenshares to 20 minutes - you may not always be able to solve the error within this time limit, but that's okay - do the best you can.

## Slack Channels - Flatiron Staff
While working on a shift, you will likely find yourself accessing a number of different Slack channels in the Flatiron Staff workspace. Below is a brief overview of what some of these channels are. For more in depth information, check out the resources at the end of this lesson.

### #technical-coaches-se
The `#technical-coaches-se` channel is used for doing your shift and all shift-related content. It's also used to greet your peers and a little chat. Please try not to flood technical coaches with chat, particularly during busy periods. If it's an in depth discussion, you can always do a group DM.

### #tc_support
The `#tc-support` channel is used for finding already answered questions as well as asking your own questions. You will want to first do a search for a question you might have. If there are no questions already answered in that topic, open your own thread with the question. Technical Coaches will then reply to any question you may have as threaded replies.


## Breaks
While on a shift, you are permitted one 10 minute break. You can take this break in the middle of your shift **as long as no other TC is already on break and there is no queue of students waiting for screenshares**. You cannot take your break in the first 30 minutes of your shift or in the last 30 minutes of your shift. Best practice is to clear it with the other coaches on shift before you take your break. If dispatch has confirmed that it's a good time for you to break, you can mark yourself as "Away" so no questions are assigned to you while you are out. When your break is done, change your status back on "Online".

If you're working a double shift, you are permitted one 30 minute break and one 10 minute break. You can't take these breaks back to back (so no 40 minutes breaks). Same rules as regular breaks apply: Take them in the middle of your shift and if no other TCs are already on break. If you're breaking for 30 minutes, try to wait until the chat is quiet and not extra busy, if possible - the other TCs on shift will thank you for it!
